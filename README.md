# How to Make VRoid Facial Expressions in Unity
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to change facial expressions on our VRoid character through the use of Blendshapes and animations in Unity. Weâ€™re going to learn what a Blendshape is, making new expressions through animations, and applying those facial expressions in the game through scripts.
